## Abstract

The European Union (EU) has identified green and low carbon Hydrogen as a pivotal component in transitioning its economy from fossil fuel dependency to a sustainable, circular, and carbon-neutral model. However, as of 2022, a staggering 96% of hydrogen production relied on natural gas, with hydrogen accounting for a mere 2% of Europe's energy consumption. To meet the strategic objective of achieving 40GW electrolyser capacity by 2030, comprehensive development of hydrogen production across the entire value chain, from production to consumption and transportation, is imperative. The EU has introduced the concept of "Hydrogen Valleys" to stimulate local production and demand, fostering regional hydrogen economies that engage citizens.

This master's thesis aims to explore the hydrogen ecosystem within Hydrogen Valleys through industrial cluster analysis, leveraging firm-level spatial data from diverse sources. By conducting an initial screening of available data sources and synthesizing relevant information, this study will employ Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to visualize the landscape of existing valleys, identify potential emerging regions, and outline key characteristics of the hydrogen economy.

## Research Questions

1. **Geographical Distribution and Clustering**
   - Where and how are the hydrogen clusters geographically distributed across Europe, and what does this distribution reveal about the spatial concentration and development of the hydrogen economy?
   - Sub-questions:
     - Does the hydrogen economy in Europe exhibit clustering behaviour, and if so, which regions in Europe exhibit the highest levels of clustering as indicated by a firm-level cluster index?
     - Where could potential hydrogen valleys emerge in selected European countries, and where are existing hydrogen valleys developing?

2. **Hydrogen Value Chain**
   - How is the hydrogen value chain distributed across different European countries?
   - Sub-questions:
     - How do different European countries perform across various segments of the hydrogen value chain, and what patterns emerge from their relative distribution of activities?
     - Which countries have the most advanced hydrogen value chains, and which are still emerging?
     - Are there connections between different value chain components that positively or negatively influence each other?

## Methodology

### Data Gathering

- Various data sources were aggregated and cleaned to create a comprehensive dataset.
- Firm-level data includes the name of the company and its exact location (street, house number, and postcode).
- Benchmark data was obtained using the Amadeus database for the Energy Sector in the EU.

### Analysis

- **Cluster Analysis:**
  - The firm-level cluster index developed by Scholl & Brenner (2016) was used to assess the degree of spatial concentration of hydrogen firms.
  - DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) and KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) were used for additional spatial analysis.

- **GIS Visualization:**
  - Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were employed to visualize the hydrogen landscape, including production sites, consumption centers, and other attributes.
